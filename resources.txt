Whenever you are stuck I suggest you google the error. I will tell you some communities
and places to find code and resolve doubts. 90% of times you can google and figure it out.
These are my favourite websites:
geeksforgeeks.com
programiz.com
stackoverflow.com

Most probably other sites will pop up when you google so just google it.
The best solutions are usually on these websites.
