# Numbers with decimal parts are called floats
# Numbers without the decimal parts are called int or integers

print(10 / 10)# 10 divided by 10
print(10 * 10)# 10 times 10
print(10 // 10)# 10 times 10 without the decimal part
print(10 ** 10)# 10 to the power of 10
print(10 + 10)# 10 plus 10
print(10 - 10)# 10 minus 10
print(11 % 10)# the remainder of 11 divided by 10
print(11 == 10)# Checks whether 11 is equal to 10 or not, print True or False based on outcome
print((10 // 4) ** 3)# Anything in brackets will have higher priorty just like BODMAS
